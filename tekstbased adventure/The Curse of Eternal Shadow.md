ancient curse, evil witch vs pure witch who is the cure (she is a plant now trapped in this cave)

A very long time ago there was a battle between two powerful witches, one evil and one good. The evil witch used dark magic to trap the good witch Luminara. It is said Luminara's soul is still trapped in this cave system. Out of this incident came a powerful curse: the Curse of Eternal Shadow. The curse slowly weakens the victims life force. At some point, the victim's skin turns ashen and cold and they get weaker and weaker until finally they succumb to the illness.

The daughters mom believed her daughter was destined for greatness, and in her jealousy she wanted to prevent that from happening. The curse was meant to ensure that the girl would never enjoy the light of day or experience happiness.

The cure is a small golden flower, a symbol of hope and radiance. It's called Luminara's Tear, after the witch who gave her life defending the village from the evil witch. The buds of the Luminara';s Tear are shaped like tiny dewdrops, filled with a darkblue liquid that sparkles like a thousand stars.
